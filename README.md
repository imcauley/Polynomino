# Polynomino
Program to check if a set of polynominos can fit on a given board.

## Input/Output:
Input is a text file with the following lines:
1. Size of board (width height)
2. Number of polynominos
3. Each folloing line is a polynomino starting with the size and then the relative coordinates

Output is a true or false.
If it is true the program will also output the arrangement that the given polynominos fit on the given board.

## Use:
` polynomino text_file.txt `

## Implementation:
See each file for implementation details
